# Spring Core Overview

Spring Core is the backbone of the Spring Framework. It provides the essential features that support the entire ecosystem, including:

- Inversion of Control (IoC)
- Dependency Injection (DI)
- Bean lifecycle management
- Context and container management

Spring Core promotes loose coupling and increased testability by managing object creation and their dependencies through a powerful container.

## Key Components

- **IoC Container**: Responsible for instantiating, configuring, and managing the lifecycle of Spring beans.
- **Beans**: Objects managed by the Spring container.
- **ApplicationContext**: The core interface to access Spring beans and features like internationalization and AOP.

This module lays the foundation for other Spring modules like Spring MVC, Spring AOP, Spring Data, etc.
